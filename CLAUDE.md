# CLAUDE.md

> **Resuming work? Read [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) first** — current status, the exact pipeline commands, and the prioritized next gaps (fill 4 unsourced India experts, US-alignment coverage, us-western real extraction, new views).

## What this is

Worldview — a public site mapping named experts' positions onto comparable axes, rendered as an opinion wheel with per-topic spectra, receipts, and side-by-side comparison. **Centered on Indian politics**: the `india` frame is the default wheel (national blend — governance, economy, institutions, strategic posture); `us-western` is secondary. The India wheel is now **real** (claims extracted from experts' op-eds, status `extracted`, every dot quote-backed); the US/Western wheel is still `illustrative`. Live at worldview.dhanjit.me (Cloudflare Worker, static assets).

India-frame editorial rules: summaries are hedged characterizations ("has argued…"), culture-war axes stay out of the catalog until extraction provides verbatim receipts (see docs/DESIGN.md "India frame"), and missing positions are omitted, never invented.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` / `npm run build` / `npm run preview`
- `npm run typecheck` — strict TS, no emit
- `infisical run -- npm run extract -- [--source wikipedia|oped] "<expert name / id>"` — source-agnostic extractor (`scripts/extract.mjs`): one core (prompt → LLM → schema enforcement → verbatim-quote guard → frame/type validation) behind adapters. `wikipedia` (default) reads the expert's Wikipedia views sections; `oped` reads their columns from `scripts/data/sources.json`. Op-ed is the real claim source — Wikipedia is too thin (proven 2026-06-13). `infisical run` injects `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (resolution env var → `.env` → DPAPI vault). Model = `EXTRACT_MODEL` (default `anthropic/claude-opus-4.8`; cheap swaps `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro`, `qwen/qwen3.7-max`). Writes to `data/extracted/<id>.<source>.json` (gitignored; review before promoting into `src/data/claims.json`).
- Provider-agnostic by decision — never hard-wire one LLM SDK; model is always an env var. **Op-ed legal posture:** article bodies live in memory only and are never persisted; only quote+summary+url+date reach a claim. Respect robots.txt, rate-limit. Don't add a source adapter that stores full copyrighted text. (Supply-chain: chose `@mozilla/readability`+`linkedom` over `@extractus/article-extractor`, which pulls a scoped `@pwshub/bellajs` fork — verify transitive deps.)

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs typecheck + build on every push and PR. Keep both green.

## Architecture

- The atom is the claim record (`Claim` in [src/lib/types.ts](src/lib/types.ts)): expert × topic × type (`should`/`is`/`will`) × frame, score 0–100 along the topic's axis, summary, verbatim quote, sourceUrl, saidOn vs aboutWhen (two distinct time dimensions), confidence, status (`illustrative` → `extracted` → `reviewed`).
- Claims are append-only and `claimFor()` returns the LATEST position (newest `saidOn`, fallback `retrievedOn`). A changed mind = a new claim, never an edit; `claimHistoryFor()` is the drift-view query. Never render a non-latest claim as current.
- Every view is a query over claims. The wheel is should-claims grouped by topic (plus one will-type axis, `ord`). Planned views — state-of-the-world (`is`), per-expert futures (`will`), ask-anything composition — must reuse the store, not grow new models.
- Data flow: `src/data/*.json` → joins in [src/lib/data.ts](src/lib/data.ts) → components ([Wheel](src/components/Wheel.tsx), [TopicPanel](src/components/TopicPanel.tsx), [ComparePanel](src/components/ComparePanel.tsx)).
- No UI framework beyond React; hand-rolled CSS in [src/styles.css](src/styles.css) with light/dark via `prefers-color-scheme`. Keep the bundle lean.

## Product rules (non-negotiable)

1. **Receipts.** Never render a stance without source URL and dates. `claim.status` stays visible in the UI until a claim is `reviewed`. A claim without a verbatim quote keeps `confidence` below `high`.
2. **Axes are editorial.** Topic axes are hand-curated with written rubrics in [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md). Changing an axis's wording means re-scoring every claim on it — never silently reinterpret scores.
3. **A perspective is its own wheel.** Own questions, own roster, own pole wording, tracked by the mandatory `frame` field. Never present one frame's wheel as neutral, and never make frame a silent filter.
4. **Composition, never ventriloquism.** Future composed answers may only assemble real claims, with provenance tiers: direct claim / school-level composition (labeled) / declared gap. Never synthesize what a named person "would" say. Gaps are content.
5. **Licensing.** Wikipedia text is CC BY-SA 4.0: attribute, quote verbatim, prefer linking the underlying primary citation pulled from `<ref>` tags.

## Conventions

- TypeScript strict; `noUnusedLocals`/`noUnusedParameters` are on.
- Short stable ids (`mear`, `ukr`, `us-western`); claim ids `<expert>-<topic>`.
- Seed data lives in `src/data/` and is committed; pipeline output lives in `data/extracted/` and is not.
- Scores are integers 0–100 toward `poleB`; `null` means "no public position found", which is itself signal — don't invent one.

## Roadmap (abridged — details in docs/DESIGN.md)

v1 wheel with real extracted receipts → v1.5 state-of-the-world view (`is` claims, facts-vs-values split) → v2 primary-source ingestion, futures view, accountability ledger → v3 ask-anything composed answers. Deferred: expert "debates".
